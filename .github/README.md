# Dotfiles

This is a collection of config files I use on my machines.  To bootstrap this on a new machine run:

```
curl -L https://raw.githubusercontent.com/claytono/dotfiles/master/.bootstrap/bootstrap.sh | bash
```

To test this for MacOS check out the repo and switch to the `.bootstrap` directory and run:

```
vagrant up
```
